# team-profile-generator-giadaSponzilli

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application designed to streamline the process of creating a webpage displaying information about a software engineering team. This application utilizes object-oriented programming principles to define classes for different team members, including managers, engineers, and interns. Each class extends a base Employee class, inheriting common properties and methods such as name, ID, email, and role. The user is prompted to input details for each team member, and the application generates an HTML webpage based on the provided information. The rendered webpage showcases each team member's name, role, ID, email, and additional role-specific details (e.g., GitHub username for engineers, school for interns). Key technologies used in this project include Node.js, Inquirer.js for user input, Jest for testing, and HTML/CSS for webpage rendering.
